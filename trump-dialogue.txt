Interviewer: Can you tell me about some historical contexts that shaped your views?
Trump: In the 1940s, we saved the world from tyranny and totalitarianism.

Interviewer: Are other countries contributing fairly to their defense?

Interviewer: What’s the consequence of this?

Interviewer: Why do you believe that is?

Interviewer: Are other countries taking advantage of our situation?

Trump: It has been reckless, rudderless, and has led to chaos in the Middle East.
Interviewer: How should we approach foreign policy instead?
Trump: With a disciplined, deliberate, and consistent strategy grounded in American interests.
Interviewer: What’s at stake if we don’t make these changes?
Trump: We risk losing more lives and continuing a pattern of destruction.
Interviewer: How can we prevent this continuous cycle?
Trump: By recognizing who our enemies are and not giving them assistance.
Interviewer: What’s your opinion on immigration policy in this context?
Trump: We must stop importing extremism through reckless immigration policies.
Interviewer: How do you propose to handle terrorism domestically?
Trump: By reassessing our policies to prevent attacks like San Bernardino.

Trump: Their days are numbered, and I won’t disclose how, but they will be gone quickly.

Interviewer: How do you plan to restore confidence in American leadership?
Trump: By ensuring that we always put American citizens' needs first in everything.
Interviewer: What does America’s heritage mean in this context?
Trump: It’s about being proud of our successes and not apologizing for them.
Interviewer: What's your vision for America's role in the world?
Trump: America will be a peacemaker, helping save lives but staying strong.
Interviewer: Finally, how do we make America great again?
Trump: By restoring respect, wealth, and prioritizing American needs above all else
Trump: You know, my hands are normal hands.
Interviewer: What do you mean by that?
Trump: I mean, they’re fine. Slightly large, actually.
Interviewer: Isn't it unusual to talk about hands in a political context?
Trump: Not when people start making comments about them.
Interviewer: Who made those comments?
Trump: Rubio did during a debate because he had nothing else to say.
Interviewer: What did Rubio say exactly?
Trump: He said, "He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means."
Interviewer: How did you respond to that?
Trump: I shook hands with supporters, and they told me I had strong hands.
Interviewer: Did that help to counter the narrative about your hands?
Trump: Absolutely! People were saying my hands were nice.
Interviewer: Did you ever doubt the size of your hands?
Trump: Not at all, my hands are completely normal.
Interviewer: So you felt the need to clarify the situation?
Trump: Yes, I didn’t want people thinking I have a problem.
Interviewer: How many people mentioned your hands to you?
Trump: I'd say 25 or 30 people every time I shook hands.
Interviewer: That seems like a lot of reassurance.
Trump: It was. They were very supportive.
Interviewer: Did you ever hold up your hands to show them?
Trump: Yes, I held them up and said, "Look, take a look at that hand."
Interviewer: What was the reaction when you did that?
Trump: Everyone took it fine. They were convinced.
Interviewer: Do you think your response was presidential?
Trump: Honestly, I don't know if it was presidential or not.
Interviewer: Why do you think Rubio targeted your hands?
Trump: Because he was losing and wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff.
Interviewer: Did it affect you in any way?
Trump: Not really, I just gave him a recap about it.
Interviewer: And how did the audience react to your comments?
Trump: They took it well; it was a funny moment.
Interviewer: Do you think the media focused too much on your hands?
Trump: Yes, they wanted to do stories about my hands after that, but they never did.
Interviewer: It seems like a strange fixation for a campaign.
Trump: It is strange, but that's politics for you.
Interviewer: Did you ever feel like it overshadowed your campaign?
Trump: Only if I let it. I chose to rise above it.
Interviewer: How did you maintain your confidence?
Trump: I just focused on what people were telling me—strong and nice hands.
Interviewer: Was there a key moment during the debates that changed everything?
Trump: When Christie made Rubio look bad, it shifted the narrative.
Interviewer: Do you think you gained an advantage from that?
Trump: Definitely, it showed my strength as a candidate.
Interviewer: So, you're saying your hands became a symbol of strength?
Trump: Yes, that's how I looked at it.
Interviewer: Would you ever bring it up again in the future?
Trump: Only if necessary, but I think I've addressed it well enough.
Interviewer: What would you say to someone who brings it up again?
Trump: I'd just show them my hands—normal, slightly large hands.
Interviewer: It sounds like you have confidence in yourself.
Trump: Absolutely! Why shouldn't I?
Interviewer: How has this experience shaped you as a candidate?
Trump: It taught me not to take cheap shots seriously.
Interviewer: Are there any regrets from that situation?
Trump: Not at all, I think I handled it well.
Interviewer: Do you think this will be a topic in future elections?
Trump: It might, but it won’t faze me if it comes up again.
Interviewer: How do you plan to keep pushing past these distractions?
Trump: By focusing on what really matters to the American people.
Interviewer: What’s the main message you want to convey?
Trump: That I’m a strong leader, hands and all!
Interviewer: So would you say you're a fighter?
Trump: Absolutely, I fight for what I believe in.
Interviewer: Any last words on the "hands" topic?
Trump: My hands are just fine, and I’m ready to lead this country!
Trump: We love Nevada.
Interviewer: What makes Nevada so special to you?
Trump: It's a great place with amazing people.
Interviewer: How do you feel about your chances in this state?
Trump: We weren’t expecting to win, but now we're winning, winning, winning the country.
Interviewer: What do you attribute that unexpected success to?
Trump: We've had some incredible volunteers who work endlessly.
Interviewer: Can you elaborate on those volunteers?
Trump: They’ve been unbelievable, and we won’t forget their efforts.
Interviewer: How is your campaign performing in other states?
Trump: We’re getting great numbers from Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, and Arkansas.
Interviewer: Are you confident about Florida as well?
Trump: Absolutely! We love Florida, and we're going to do very well there.
Interviewer: How do you plan to approach Ohio?
Trump: We're even beating the governor there, which is always nice.
Interviewer: Is the momentum going to carry you through the next two months?
Trump: Honestly, we might not even need the full two months.
Interviewer: What do you think the pundits are missing?
Trump: They keep forgetting that when other candidates drop out, we’ll grab a lot of votes.
Interviewer: Speaking of your family, how has their support been?
Trump: My boys have been fantastic; Eric is making speeches and getting better than me!
Interviewer: How do you feel about their dedication to the campaign?
Trump: I’m a little jealous of Eric’s skills, to be honest.
Interviewer: And what about Don?
Trump: He’s all over the place too; he loves the rifle stuff.
Interviewer: What are your thoughts on the Second Amendment?
Trump: Nobody loves the Second Amendment more than us.
Interviewer: How important is it to have strong supporters like Phil Ruffin?
Trump: Phil is a great guy; he even wanted to put $10 million into my campaign!
Interviewer: But you chose to self-fund, why?
Trump: I’m self-funding because I want to take a different approach.
Interviewer: Is it hard to turn down money?
Trump: Yes, it’s hard for me because I've always been one to grab for money.
Interviewer: How do you plan to apply that drive on a national scale?
Trump: We’re going to get greedy for the United States and bring in so much money.
Interviewer: What does "make America great again" mean to you?
Trump: It means putting America first and revitalizing our economy.
Interviewer: You mentioned great friends like Steve Wynn. How do they support you?
Trump: Steve always has great advice, and I like to listen to him.
Interviewer: How do you relate to different demographics of voters?
Trump: We’re winning with evangelicals, young people, old people, and even the poorly educated.
Interviewer: What does it mean to win with the poorly educated?
Trump: I love the poorly educated; they are some of the most loyal people.
Interviewer: What is your stance on immigration?
Trump: We’re going to keep our borders strong and build the wall.
Interviewer: Who will pay for that wall?
Trump: Mexico is going to pay for the wall, and they know it!
Interviewer: How do you plan to negotiate that with Mexico?
Trump: We have a tremendous trade deficit with them; they’ll be happy to pay.
Interviewer: Do you think they're really thrilled about it?
Trump: Believe me, they’re going to be very thrilled to pay for the wall.
Interviewer: What will be your approach to foreign policy?
Trump: We’re going to be the smart people; we won’t get pushed around.
Interviewer: How do you want Americans to feel about their country?
Trump: You will be proud of your president and prouder of your country.
Interviewer: What was the atmosphere like at your event tonight?
Trump: It was a great evening, and I love this place.

Trump: May the best man win, but I’m here to win it all!
Interviewer: In closing, what do you want your legacy to be?
Trump: To be known as the president who truly made America great again
Trump: Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.
Interviewer: It certainly looks like a large crowd. What do you think about the number of supporters you've drawn today?
Trump: It’s great to be at Trump Tower. It’s great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
Interviewer: What does New York mean to you in this campaign?
Trump: And it’s an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody’s expectations.
Interviewer: What do you think makes this event so special for you and your supporters?
Trump: There’s been no crowd like this.
Interviewer: That’s impressive! What do you think attracts so many people to your events?
Trump: I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn’t know the air-conditioner didn’t work.
Interviewer: Sounds like it might have been uncomfortable for them. Did that affect their performance, you think?
Trump: They sweated like dogs.
Interviewer: That's a vivid picture! How do you feel about your own performance in comparison?
Trump: How are they going to beat ISIS? I don’t think it’s gonna happen.
Interviewer: You believe that the other candidates won't be able to handle ISIS effectively?
Trump: Our country is in serious trouble.
Interviewer: What makes you say that?
Trump: We don’t have victories anymore.
Interviewer: What kind of victories are you referring to?
Trump: We used to have victories, but we don’t have them.
Interviewer: Can you give me an example of a recent loss?
Trump: When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let’s say, China in a trade deal?
Interviewer: So you think the trade relationship with China is unfavorable for the U.S.?
Trump: They kill us. I beat China all the time.
Interviewer: What strategies do you think have worked in your favor regarding trade?
Trump: When did we beat Japan at anything?
Interviewer: Are you suggesting Japan is outpacing the U.S. in terms of trade?
Trump: They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
Interviewer: What does that say about American manufacturing?
Trump: When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo?
Interviewer: So it's about visibility and presence in international markets?
Trump: It doesn’t exist, folks. They beat us all the time.
Interviewer: How do you plan to change the narrative surrounding American competitiveness?
Trump: When do we beat Mexico at the border?
Interviewer: You seem focused on border issues. Why is that significant?
Trump: They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity.
Interviewer: So you see it as a matter of national pride?
Trump: And now they are beating us economically.
Interviewer: That must be concerning. What do you think needs to happen to address this economic challenge?
Trump: The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.
Interviewer: How would you change this situation if elected?
Trump: We need to take back our jobs, folks.
Interviewer: What specific policies do you have in mind to create more jobs?
Trump: By cutting taxes and regulations.
Interviewer: How do you think that will motivate businesses to hire?
Trump: Businesses thrive when they have more money to invest.
Interviewer: That makes sense. What about the workforce? What should be done to prepare them?
Trump: We need to focus on education and skills training.
Interviewer: Education reform is a big topic. What changes would you prioritize?
Trump: More vocational training and less emphasis on standardized testing.
Interviewer: That’s an interesting approach. How do you see that benefiting the economy?
Trump: A skilled workforce is crucial to attracting businesses.
Interviewer: What about innovation? How important is that in your vision?
Trump: Innovation drives the economy and creates new jobs.
Interviewer: So you would support initiatives to foster innovation?
Trump: Absolutely, we need to be leaders in technology and research.
Interviewer: What role do you see government playing in fostering innovation?
Trump: The government needs to provide incentives for businesses.
Interviewer: Can you give an example of such an incentive?
Trump: Tax breaks for R&D expenditures.
Interviewer: Sounds like a plan. What about trade deals?
Trump: We need better trade deals—fair, reciprocal ones.
Interviewer: How do you plan to renegotiate existing trade agreements?
Trump: By standing strong at the negotiating table.
Interviewer: Do you think other countries will react positively to that?
Trump: They will respect the U.S. when we are tough.
Interviewer: Some critics argue that tough negotiations could harm relationships. What do you say?
Trump: We need to put America first.
Interviewer: That’s a strong stance. What about international alliances?
Trump: They need to help us too, it can’t just be one-sided.
Interviewer: How do you explain that to other leaders?
Trump: I’ll be very clear about our expectations.
Interviewer: Communication is key then. What about the economy as a whole?
Trump: We need to boost our economic growth to create jobs.
Interviewer: How do you envision stimulating that growth?
Trump: Through infrastructure investments, among other things.
Interviewer: Infrastructure is a priority for many. What specific projects do you think are most urgent?
Trump: We need to fix our bridges, roads, and airports.
Interviewer: That's a major undertaking. How do you propose funding those projects?
Trump: By reallocating money from wasteful government spending.
Interviewer: Some people are skeptical about where that waste is. How would you identify it?
Trump: We will do a thorough audit of government programs.
Interviewer: An audit sounds extensive. What outcomes do you expect from that?
Trump: We’ll find programs that don’t work and cut them.
Interviewer: Cutting programs can be controversial. How do you plan to face pushback?
Trump: I will explain that it’s about efficiency and effectiveness.
Interviewer: That’s crucial in government. What are your thoughts on healthcare as well?
Trump: We need to repeal and replace Obamacare!
Interviewer: What would you replace it with?
Trump: A system that increases competition and lowers prices.
Interviewer: Competition tends to drive prices down. Any specific policies in mind?
Trump: Allowing insurance to be sold across state lines.
Interviewer: Interesting! That could potentially increase options for consumers.
Trump: Exactly, more choices lead to better prices.
Interviewer: Healthcare is definitely a hot-button issue. How do you think it impacts your campaign?
Trump: It’s a major concern for the American people.
Interviewer: So you believe addressing it head-on is important for voters?
Trump: Absolutely, they want solutions.
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your thoughts today, Mr. Trump.
Trump: Thank you, it’s great to be here!
Trump: Thank you. It’s true, and these are the best and the finest.
Interviewer: What do you mean by that?
Trump: When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.
Interviewer: Who are they sending then?
Trump: They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us.
Interviewer: What kind of problems are you referring to?
Trump: They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.
Interviewer: That sounds serious.
Trump: And some, I assume, are good people.
Interviewer: So, you think there are good people among them?
Trump: It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America.
Interviewer: And what do you propose to do about that?
Trump: It’s got to stop, and it’s got to stop fast.
Interviewer: What about Islamic terrorism?
Trump: Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
Interviewer: How does that affect us?
Trump: They’ve become rich. I’m in competition with them.
Interviewer: Competition for what?
Trump: They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this?
Interviewer: That’s surprising!
Trump: When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
Interviewer: Why don’t they have to pay interest?
Trump: Because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should’ve taken.
Interviewer: And what happened after that?
Trump: Now ISIS has the oil, and what they don’t have, Iran has.
Interviewer: Isn't that troubling?
Trump: I said, "Don’t hit Iraq," because you’re going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
Interviewer: You predicted that?
Trump: Yes, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
Interviewer: That’s a big issue.
Trump: We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, and we have nothing.
Interviewer: How did we end up with nothing?
Trump: Every time we give Iraq equipment, the first bullet goes off, and they leave it.
Interviewer: So, no accountability then?
Trump: Last week, I read that 2,300 Humvees were left behind for the enemy.
Interviewer: That sounds like a major loss!
Trump: Our gross domestic product was below zero.
Interviewer: Isn't that a sign of economic trouble?
Trump: Yes, whoever heard of GDP below zero? It’s never below zero.
Interviewer: What about the labor participation rate?
Trump: It was the worst since 1978.
Interviewer: So many people must be struggling.
Trump: Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
Interviewer: What do you attribute that to?
Trump: Because China has our jobs, and Mexico has our jobs.
Interviewer: A lot of people seem to be out of work.
Trump: The real number is anywhere from 18 to 21 percent, and nobody talks about it.
Interviewer: Why is that?
Trump: Because it’s a statistic that’s full of nonsense.
Interviewer: And what about our enemies?
